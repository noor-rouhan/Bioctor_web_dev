# Bioctor_web_dev
Currently developing web API for the Website and android app for the Startup Bioctor with Laravel PHP framework where I'm currently employed as research assistant.

As it's based on laravel so the procedure of running/ testing website is just similar like other website. 
1. Clode or download the project.
2. Follow this link.
